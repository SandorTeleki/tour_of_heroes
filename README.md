# Tour of Heroes

Based on the Angular tutorail Tour of Heroes. Tutorial accessible through: https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes.

## Ideas for improvement:
- Add stats to each hero
- Ability to alter stats for heroes

## Running it locally:
- Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/SandorTeleki/tour_of_heroes.git`
- Run `npm i` to install the needed dependencies
- Run `ng serve` to spin up your local instance. It should become available through the 4200 port.
